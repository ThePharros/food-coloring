# Food Coloring
A plugin that recolors cooked Sailing and Hunter foods to have a bit more (colorful) soul to them!

## Features
* Recolors all cooked Hunter meats!
* Recolors all cooked Sailing fish! (except squids)
* Redesigns Sunlight and Moonlight Moth Mixes!
* Alternative color options for cooked Halibut!<br> (Light, Brown, Green, and Halibwan)
* Each individual item can be toggled in the config options!

## Before and After

### Known Issues

* Some inventory-locked interfaces show full opacity rather than partial.

* The sprites used for banknotes of targeted foods aren't perfect due to bicubic scaling. One fix would be doubling the sprites of the plugin and refactoring code, although this isn't within my planned scope and I think the scaling algorithm does a good enough job.

* Some interfaces may have been missed. If you detect any that the plugin is ignoring, please let me know!
